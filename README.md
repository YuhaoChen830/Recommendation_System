# Moive Recommendation System Using Spark Alternating Least Squares (ALS)

In this project, I build a recommender engine using Apache Spark on Databricks. The recommendation model is trained on MovieLens datasets downloaded from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/ using matrix factorization method and Alternating Least Square technology.

The notebook file is generated on Databricks and can be opened using Google Colab.
